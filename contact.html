This drop offset predominantly positive earnings reports from the US. Treasury bond yields fell notably, and the Conference Board's consumer confidence index declined to 101.3 in April. While the majority of US earnings reports exceeded expectations, regional banks' deposit concerns continued to weigh on the market.|||

The Stoxx Europe 600 closed down, and London's FTSE 100 also lost value due to struggles in the commodity sector. In contrast, Premier Inn owner Whitbread gained after doubling its annual dividend and predicting strong demand during the King's coronation.|||

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) proposed to loosen loan-to-value ratio (LVR) restrictions, while the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) anticipated a further slowdown in the Australian economy, affecting stubborn inflation. The cross experienced a significant sell-off in the previous two trading sessions due to expectations that the RBA would maintain steady interest rates next week.|||

NYMEX iron ore futures were last traded at US$116.76/MT. In New Zealand, Westland Dairy Company announced a NZ$70m investment in its Hokitika factory to boost lactoferrin production. Meanwhile, the Commerce Commission is assessing a complaint about the LPG market, and the Reserve Bank has decided to incentivize commercial bank involvement in the government's planned Business Growth Fund.|||
