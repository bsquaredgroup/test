                        <a class="post-link" data-title="Crash" data-subtitle="Daily Report for Wednesday 12th April 2023" data-text="The New Zealand Dollar (Kiwi) is under pressure and has fallen overnight across all currency pairs, with NZDEUR reaching a 3-year low. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) potential intention to push the economy into a recession could be a reason behind this decline. However, if RBNZ Governor Orr aims to combat inflation, a weaker NZD would actually contribute to increased imported inflation. The situation might be excessive, but exporters are taking advantage of it.
                                                                                                                                       The US Dollar is weaker while equities are mostly up, although technology stocks are having a hard time. US Treasury yields are rising ahead of tonight's US Consumer Price Index (CPI) release, with the 2-year yield up 4 basis points to 4.05% and the 10-year yield up 2 basis points to 3.44%. The Dow Jones is up by 98 points, Nasdaq down by 52 points, NZX up by 4 points, and ASX up by 93 points. Crude oil (WTI) is trading at $81.37, carbon at $59.25, and Bitcoin at 30.1k.
                                                                                                                                       Bitcoin has dropped below $30,000 for the first time since June 2022, but it's still 50% below its all-time high. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has reduced its global growth forecasts by 0.1% to 2.8% for 2023 and 3% for 2024.
                                                                                                                                       Fed's new voter Goolsbee suggests that the Federal Reserve should be cautious about raising interest rates too much, while Williams leans towards a more hawkish stance, stating that one more rate hike is a reasonable starting point.
                                                                                                                                       China's credit growth is stronger than anticipated, with a 5,380 billion increase in March. Consumer inflation in the country has hit an 18-month low as factory gate prices declines have accelerated.
                                                                                                                                       Australian housing prices might have reached a turning point, as they have increased by 2% since February. New Zealand usually lags behind Australia by 3-6 months. Meanwhile, New Zealand's QV housing prices have dropped by an average of 3.9% since the beginning of the year.
                                                                                                                                       Warren Buffet is considering more investments in Japan. As for tonight, the US CPI is expected to be +0.4% month-over-month and +5.6% year-over-year.">

                        <a class="post-link" data-title="RBNZ Keeps Hiking" data-subtitle="Daily Report for Thursday 6th April 2023" data-text="I thought a 25 basis point hike would be the peak, but a 50 basis point increase is quite surprising! Despite this, they're saying that mortgage and debt arrears remain at low levels – is that really accurate? There are already 18,900 mortgages in arrears, up 23% year-over-year, which could mean big problems for banks.
                                                                                                                                                 It seems like a recession might be on the horizon, with the building, farming, and retail industries already struggling. On the bright side, they've removed the statement that monetary conditions need to tighten further. However, the market still expects another 25 basis point hike in May.
                                                                                                                                                 The New Zealand dollar (Kiwi) has been rising, but with the economy in a tough spot, it's difficult to be optimistic about anything in New Zealand. Importers have been adding to their currency hedges, and the US Dollar is now driving the direction of other currencies. With increased risk aversion, the Dollar has appreciated, pushing other currencies lower.
                                                                                                                                                 The NZD/AUD cross rate is above 0.94, and other currency pairs are also on the rise. In other market news, the Dow is up 80 points, Nasdaq is down 129 points, NZX fell 32 points, ASX is down 3 points, WTI crude oil is at $80.37, carbon is priced at $59, and Bitcoin is at $28.2k.
                                                                                                                                                 Softer ADP data, with 145k new jobs, suggests that the labor market might be cooling off. Meanwhile, the ISM services index dropped 4 points to 51.2, with new orders falling 10 points to 52.2. This led to lower US Treasury yields, with the 2-year yield down 6 basis points to 3.77% and the 10-year yield down 5 basis points to 3.29%, a new 7-month low.
                                                                                                                                                 In international news, German manufacturing rose 4.8% in February, marking the third consecutive monthly increase. Ukraine is reportedly ready to discuss Crimea with Russia if their counteroffensive is successful. Locally, Barfoot & Thompson recorded the lowest level of March home sales since the Global Financial Crisis, down 35% year-over-year.">
