This drop offset predominantly positive earnings reports from the US. Treasury bond yields fell notably, and the Conference Board's consumer confidence index declined to 101.3 in April. While the majority of US earnings reports exceeded expectations, regional banks' deposit concerns continued to weigh on the market.|||

The Stoxx Europe 600 closed down, and London's FTSE 100 also lost value due to struggles in the commodity sector. In contrast, Premier Inn owner Whitbread gained after doubling its annual dividend and predicting strong demand during the King's coronation.|||

China's CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite experienced declines, as did Hong Kong's Hang Seng and South Korea's Kospi. However, Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a slight increase.|||

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) proposed to loosen loan-to-value ratio (LVR) restrictions, while the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) anticipated a further slowdown in the Australian economy, affecting stubborn inflation. The cross experienced a significant sell-off in the previous two trading sessions due to expectations that the RBA would maintain steady interest rates next week.|||

NYMEX iron ore futures were last traded at US$116.76/MT. In New Zealand, Westland Dairy Company announced a NZ$70m investment in its Hokitika factory to boost lactoferrin production. Meanwhile, the Commerce Commission is assessing a complaint about the LPG market, and the Reserve Bank has decided to incentivize commercial bank involvement in the government's planned Business Growth Fund.|||

      <a class="post-link" data-subtitle="Daily Report for Tuesday 18th April 2023" data-text="The retail sector in New Zealand is becoming increasingly pessimistic, as more than half of the surveyed retailers missed their Q1 sales targets. This seems to be driven by factors such as local food prices rising by 2.1% in March and an impressive 12.1% year on year. Credit demand has dipped by 6.2% YoY, marking the lowest level since the first COVID lockdown. Mortgage demand has also experienced a steep drop of 20% compared to last year, which is hardly surprising given the current economic climate.|||

As a result, New Zealand may be set for the classic boom-bust cycle, with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand potentially overreacting in its policy response.|||

The Empire State Manufacturing Index soared 10.8 points, while new orders jumped 46 points to 25.1. The NAHB Homebuilder Index also increased for the fourth consecutive month to 45. Consequently, the 2-year Treasury yield rose 9 basis points to 4.19%, while the 10-year yield increased 8 basis points to 3.59%. The market is now pricing a 22 basis point rate hike for the May FOMC meeting, and expectations for rate cuts in the second half of 2023 are fading.|||

It remains unclear whether this decline is driving the Kiwi currency's underperformance or if the current account deficit is finally taking its toll. The 200-day moving average sits at 0.6160, and a break below this level could open up further downside.

This comes amid concerns that the country might already be in a recession, which could exacerbate the economic pain.

NFP increased by 238k jobs, with 47k of those being government jobs. However, the NFIB Small Business Hiring Index, a strong leading indicator, fell to a 34-month low, suggesting a possible easing in the labour market. Despite this, markets are not convinced of a Fed pause, with an 18 basis point expectation.|||
